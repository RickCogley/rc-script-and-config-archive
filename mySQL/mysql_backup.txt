        MySQL Backup v3.1
        by Peter Falkenberg Brown
        peterbrown@worldcommunity.com
        http://worldcommunity.com/opensource
        Build Date: November 21, 2003

=PURPOSE

        Backs up mysql data safely, using
        'mysqldump', 'select to outfile' or 'normal record selection'.

        This is my attempt :-) to provide a reasonably
        full featured MySQL backup script that can be
        run from:

        1. Linux Crontab or Windows Scheduler
        2. the shell or command prompt

        3. the web (with password protection)
        (Note that I don't recommend running it from the web
        because of permission issues - however, some users
        don't have shell access. It depends upon the security
        level of your data.

        It now works from both Linux and Windows.
        See URLs at the end about where to get
        WINDOWS VERSION OF UNIX UTILITIES.

        It provides options to backup all of the databases and tables
        in one particular host, with exception lists.

        It now has the ability to select a variety of options
        for the tar and gzip functions, including using the
        tar -z switch, using bzip2 and piping data through gzip/bzip2.
        It also deletes text files in between tar and gzip, to save space.

        It also works around the sql wildcard glitch with
        underlines (_), in table names, by not using mysqlshow
        to get table names. I did this, because mysqlshow db %
        didn't work under MySQL v3.22.20a, and I wasn't able to
        determine when the % method came into being (under which
        version.) So, in order to make things work for earlier
        versions, I used 'show tables'.
        (I still use mysqlshow for database names.)

=head1 WINDOWS VERSION OF UNIX UTILITIES

        Here are some urls for windows versions of the unix utilities
        that I use in this program.
        Note that there are some differences:

        - chmod doesn't mean much on Winx (I use Perl's internal chmod
          so that utility doesn't have to be imported anyway).

        - tar won't filter through gzip

        1. UnxUtils (bzip2, gzip, ls, tar)
        ----- http://www.weihenstephan.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html
              !!!(can't pipe to gzip, can't create tar.gz)
        
        2. shell utils (nice)
        ----- http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sh-utils.htm

        3. cron for windows
        ----- http://www.kalab.com/freeware/cron/cron.htm
              you can use cron for windows or Windows Scheduler
              (or one of the other numerous scheduling utilities)

        4. libintl-2.dll and libiconv-2.dll
        ----- http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libintl.htm
              You may need to install these dlls in your
              \windows\system directory. See Windows notes in setup.
              I only tested this in Win98. I didn't run into the problem
              in Windows 2000, but my testing wasn't extensive there.

=BACKUP DATE STRING NOTES

        This is a handy method to initialize date display
        it requires the POSIX and Time::Local calls above
        I use this because I got tired of messing with date routines

        e.g: $backup_date_string = strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S", localtime);

        - strftime notes:
        If you want your code to be portable, your format argument
        should use only the conversion specifiers defined by the ANSI C
        standard. These are:

        a A b B c d H I j m M p S U w W x X y Y Z %

        DON'T USE: C D e E F G g h k l n O P r R s t T u V z +
        They usually work under Linux, but not necessarily under WinX.

        I specifically had problems with 'e' and 'l'.
        They didn't work on a Win2000 machine I tested them on.
        I had to change them from 'e' to 'd' and 'l' to 'I'.

        Note that 'e' and 'l' wouldn't normally be used for
        a file name string anyway, because of the spaces in their output.

        %e - Like  %d, the day of the month as a decimal number,
	       but a leading zero is replaced by a space. (SU)

        %d - The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

        %l - The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range
	       1 to  12);  single digits are preceded by a blank.
	       (See also %I.) (TZ)

        %I - The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock
             (range 01 to 12).

        .......................................................................
        Rather than list all the code definitions, here's a url to visit a
        Unix manpage site, such as: http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi
        (type in 'strftime').

        Or, from the shell prompt, type in 'man strftime'.

=VERSION HISTORY

v.3.1 - Nov. 21, 2003    - Added code to check if file has already been
                           uploaded to the ftp site -- it yes, aborts.

                           Note that if your filename has seconds
                           in the datetime string, you shouldn't run into
                           the ftp overwrite / bad file descriptor problem.
                           In any case, the script will abort if the file exists.

                         - Added code to check the filesize of the uploaded file,
                           and removed code that simply listed the name

                         - rearranged the order of the message/code lines
                           in the ftp section to be clearer
                           
                         - changed order of --result-file in mysqldump
                           to *before* the dbname

v.3.0 - May 17, 2003     - Note that I skipped from 2.7 to 3.0
                           because I consider this a 'major' upgrade.

                         - See the end of this v3.0 section for acknowledgements.

                         - NEW: MYSQLDUMP --RESULT-FILE FLAG!
                           new method of invoking mysqldump: --result-file
                           NOTE!! some earlier versions of mysqldump don't
                           have the --result-file flag -- if your version
                           doesn't, you may have to
                           a) upgrade mysql or
                           b) use the outfile or normal_select method
                           I tested it on:
                           - Linux with MySQL v3.23.54 - worked fine
                           - Win98 with MySQL v3.23.33 - no result-file flag
                           I searched and SEARCHED :-) through the History
                           notes at mysql.com to find out when they introduced
                           the result-file flag, but I haven't found it yet.
                           If someone finds it, let me know.

                           I use the --result-file=$file and system call method
                           with mysqldump because I had problems with the
                           backtick and > redirection symbol on Win98, running
                           from the script. I'm still trying to figure out why.
                           Also note that the system method with a list
                           doesn't invoke the shell, so that we don't run into
                           the 127 character command limit on Win98.

                         - I now longer parse the cnf file manually.
                           (I actually didn't use the parsed data
                           in 2.7, but I hadn't deleted the code.)
                           If you select cnf_file, mysqlshow and mysqldump
                           will use the cnf_group variable
                           thus, your cnf file can include
                           multiple groups if you wish.

                         - added the mysqlshow and mysqldump flag:
                           --defaults-extra-file=$cnf_file
                           so that cron will find the correct cnf file
                           Thanks to Kaloyan Tenchov.
                           
                         - added a note about the env var:
                           $ENV{'MYSQL_UNIX_PORT'}.
                           If your MySQL socket file is NOT
                           in a default directory, such as:
                           /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
                           then you may need to use the above
                           environment command.

                         - uncommented
                           $dbh->{PrintError} = 1;
                           $dbh->{RaiseError} = 0;
                           and changed PrintError to 1
                           and RaiseError to 0
                           so that errors don't cause the
                           script to die, but still provide output

                         - added variable for the command 'ls'

                         - removed the need for the utility commands
                           find, rm, xargs, wc
                           by recoding two subroutines in Perl.
                           (delete_text_files and clean_old_files)
                           (There's always more than one way to do it. :-)
                           This was stimulated by the problems with
                           backticks and pipes on Win98.
                           I now use File::Path to remove directories
                           and simple directory arrays to remove files,
                           since the directories aren't nested.

                         - added note with urls to get windows
                           versions of unix utilities used in the script

                         - updated automatic method of the whereis
                           section that finds commands (cleaner)

                         - added chomp command to whereis output

                         - added routine to check for script utilities
                           on the disk and abort with error if not found

                         - changed the zip filename in the MIME::Lite
                           attachment section to not have the path

                         - added a bit of code to clear the screen when
                           the script is run (from the shell)

                         - added option for bzip2
                         - added options for gzip and bzip2 parameters
                         - changed gzip output labels to include bzip2

                         - added a compress_method option for
                           standard two step compression, or tar -z,
                           or the tar gzip pipe method.

                         - changed code to delete text files in between
                           tar and gzip if options are set.

                         - moved code to delete text files into subroutine

                         - modified some of the output

                         - added a variable $print_stdout
                           so that if it's not set to 'yes', the messages
                           will only get sent to the admin email, rather
                           than printed to the stdout (screen)
                           Thanks to Matthew Moffitt for the idea.

                         - create &message subroutine to make the print
                           and $body_text email statements cleaner.
                           (the &message subroutine allows selective
                           output, using 's' for screen, 'e' for email,
                           and 'b' for both)

                         - fixed mysql outfile method,
                           by chmoding tar_dir to 777 so that mysql
                           can write to that directory.
                           Also added full path name to the outfile.

                           (The last time I tested the outfile method,
                           I was using a separate instance of mysql,
                           running as my own user, rather than 'mysql',
                           which is why it worked then, but not when
                           it runs as mysql.)

                         - added code to chmod tar_dir to 700 if
                           $chmod_backup_file is set to yes; otherwise
                           it's chmoded to 755 (from 777 - see above)

                         - added error routines to check for the creation
                           of tar_dir, the existence of mysql_backup_dir,
                           the creation of the backup files, and the
                           deletion of the files to be deleted.

                         - added a number of variables and code bits
                           that allow one to run the script from the
                           web, with a password protected login,
                           for users that don't have shell access.

                         - re-arranged the layout of some of the setup
                           variables, to be more convenient (some are
                           closer to the top of the file).

                         - added notes about libintl-2.dll and libiconv-2.dll
                           I needed to install these dlls in \windows\system
                           under Win98.

                         - added the record delimiter :!: to the outfile and
                           normal select method of backing up (with a \n)
                           to accomodate multiline text records easily

                         - note about segmentation faults on startup:
                           As far as I can tell, some versions of DBI/DBD::mysql
                           caused a fault when the connect parameters
                           'mysql_read_default_file=$cnf_file"' and
                           'mysql_read_default_group=$cnf_group"' were used.
                           The mysql site has notes about this.
                           If you're experiencing this:
                           1. try to use the 'this_file' method of connecting,
                              and commment out the cnf file params, and
                           2. check out the mysql site for a better version
                              of DBI/DBD.

                         - modified the email commands to use Net::SMTP
                           for Windows users (or for anyone)
                           Note that to successfully email from Windows,
                           with Net::SMTP, you need to connect to a running
                           mailserver. I had good results with the Microsoft
                           IIS mailserver on Win2000, although it was a pain
                           to setup (I didn't set it up :-).

                         - placed die print commands in Mime::Lite routines,
                           instead of &error_message, because &error_message
                           invokes the email routine, which would cause a loop.

                         - confirmed that passive ftp with ssh tunneling works.

                         - moved the contents of $mysqldump_params into the
                           subroutine do_backup, because of the system call syntax.

                         - added notes about strftime under WinX.

                         - moved the use Net::FTP; and use MIME::Lite;
                           lines up to the associated vars for convenience.

                         - Acknowledgements:
                           =================
                           Thanks to all the suggestions, code ideas and
                           patch contributions from our users!
                           About patches: I usually "integrate" patches,
                           or patch ideas, into the program within my own
                           particular coding style. So, most patches won't
                           appear exactly as submitted (often because I
                           change things alot as I upgrade.)

                           However, I deeply appreciate the patch efforts,
                           and code suggestions. v3.0 is due to all of your
                           comments and input! Thanks go to: (listed by alpha)

v2.7 - June 11, 2002     - Bug fix:
                           moved the two 'use' statements for
                           Net::FTP and MIME::Lite to the top of the file
                           with instructions to comment out those two lines
                           if the libraries aren't installed, since the
                           'use' lines do get parsed.

v2.6 - June 10, 2002     - added the ftp_option
                           The initial ftp code was contributed by
                           Gil Hildebrand, Jr. (root@moflava.net)
                           with additional code by myself.
                           (added error checking, extra params, etc.)

                         - added code to skip loading
                           Net::FTP and MIME::Lite if
                           $ftp_backup and $email_backup are set to 'no'
                           If you don't want to install them,
                           you no longer have to comment out code sections.
                           (see v2.7 above for bug fix)
                           (the main code doesn't have to be commented out,
                           but the 'use' lines do.)

                         - changed semi-colon ; to comma , after:
                           attach $msg ....
                                  Path     =>"$backup_gzip_file",
                           Thanks to Kenneth Martis for finding the bug.

                         - added a segment under $find_commands
                           to configure the paths for the command line utils
                           mysqldump, mysqlshow, nice, tar, gzip
                           Thanks to Luc Schiltz for the concept.
                           NOTE: If you use the automatic option, you
                           should of course check the results.

                         - added --host=$db_host to
                           mysqlshow and mysqldump commands
                           so one can use a remote host.
                           Thanks to Serge Colin and Gil Hildebrand, Jr.
                           for the suggestion.

                         - separated Mandatory Variables from Optional Variables
                           in the setup section, to make setup quicker.

v2.5 - March 1, 2002     - removed the password from the mysqldump and mysqlshow
                           lines if .cnf files are being used, since using the
                           user/pass on the command line shows up in 'ps'.
                           (Thus, it's highly advisable to use a .cnf file!)

                         - added $show_file_list_in_email var, to trim large emails.
                           The file list will not be included in the email unless
                           the var is set to 'yes'.

                         - Added functionality to backup LARGE systems, i.e:
                         - changed the tar method to tar a subdirectory with all
                           the files, so tar doesn't choke if there are too many
                           files. The subdir is removed once the tar file is made,
                           if $delete_text_files is set to yes. If not, the files
                           in old tar_dirs are cleaned out later by clean_old_files.

                         - modified 'ls -la' to use xargs so that large directories
                           don't choke.

v2.4 - June 20, 2001     - A bug fix of a bug fix. Oy.
                           Changed 'w_user' and 'w_password'
                           in the setup section back to 'user' and 'password'
                           to make it more consistent with .cnf files, and to
                           fix a bug I created when I changed it in v2.2
                           (with mysqldump looking for $user)
                           Now, we use $user and $password everywhere.
                           Thanks to our sharp eyed users!

v2.3 - June 5, 2001      - Changed the ~/ for the home directory in the vars
                           $cnf_file, $ENV{'MYSQL_UNIX_PORT'} and $mysql_backup_dir
                           to use absolute paths instead of the ~/. The ~/ didn't
                           work, and is a fine example of the need for testing :-)
                           I thought I was being clever and convenient, but I
                           actually didn't use it on my system (I used the absolute
                           paths instead.) Thanks to Rick Morbey in London.

v2.2 - May 25, 2001      - Bug fix; a typo. Changed 'user' and 'password'
                           in the setup section to 'w_user' and 'w_password'
                           so that the connect_to_db routine works.
                           Thanks to Glen Knoch.

v2.1 - May 23, 2001      - First public release of new Perl version
                         - bug fixes and added some options
                           . changed 'mysqlshow db %' for tables, to 'show tables'
                           . added prefixes to file deletes for safety
                           . fixed error in regex that checked for text file delete
                           . changed %e to %d in date string for file name
                           . added vars for nice, tar, gzip paths
                           . removed &error_message($error_text) from &mail_to,
                             to avoid recursive loop, since &error_message calls &mail_to
                           . fixed error in attached email file path
                           . commented out $dbh->{PrintError} = 1; and
                                           $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1; so that the script
                                           wouldn't die before emailing the error.
                           . made all vars in &do_backup 'my' to avoid conflicts

v2.0 - February 15, 2001 - completely rewritten as a Perl script
                           . added all core options

v1.0 - January 2, 2000   - written as a simple shell script
